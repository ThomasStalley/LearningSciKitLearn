**_Iris Species Prediction:_**

- Using a model trained on Iris flower measurements (petal length, petal width, sepal legth, speal width) we predict the
  species.

**_House Value Prediction:_**

- Using a model trained on California housing data (bedrooms, bathrooms, lat, lng...), we predict the house value.

Values capped at $500k in raw data, leading to anomalous predictions:
